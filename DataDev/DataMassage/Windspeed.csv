EEOWindspeed,Climate,TERN,Windspeed,Monthly, Near-Surface Wind Speed v10,m/s,"Daily near-surface wind speeds (u) grids have been developed over all of Australia at a 0.01° spatial resolution by interpolating terrestrial anemometers measurements from an expanded network for 1975–2006. For these new grids, the Australian-averaged u trend for 1975–2006 was -0.009 m s-1 a-1 (agreeing with earlier site-based studies) with stilling over 88% of the land-surface.
